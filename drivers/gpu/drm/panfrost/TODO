- Thermal support.

- Bifrost support:
  - DT bindings (Neil, WIP)
  - MMU page table format and address space setup
  - Bifrost specific feature and issue handling
  - Coherent DMA support

- Per FD address space support. The h/w supports multiple addresses spaces.
  The hard part is handling when more address spaces are needed than what
  the h/w provides.

- Support userspace controlled GPU virtual addresses. Needed for Vulkan. (Tomeu)

- Compute job support. So called 'compute only' jobs need to be plumbed up to
  userspace.
